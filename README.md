# Data Exploration of Plant Viruses and Climate Correlation

The goal of this data exploration was to examine the effects weather might have on disease infection level in peonies. In order to do so I worked under supervision of a phytopathologist who provided me with a plant data collected on two different locations (North America and Europe) and had to write an algorithm to gather meteorological data for appropriate dates and locations. Primary motivation for the scientists in such correlation is to find species (cultivars) of peonies that are resistant to disease with changes in humidity (and other weather factors), thus can be revealed some genetic markers (adaptations) that can appeal to direct consumers and other researchers.
